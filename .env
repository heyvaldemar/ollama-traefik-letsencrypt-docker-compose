# Define the models to be installed in the Ollama service. Separate each model name with a comma
# Recommended sources for finding models compatible with Ollama:
# 1. Ollama Official Website - https://ollama.com/library: Visit the official Ollama website for detailed information
#    on available models and how to use them with the platform
# 2. Hugging Face Model Hub - https://huggingface.co/models: Ollama supports many models from Hugging Face
#    You can search and explore models across various categories such as NLP, vision, and more
# 3. Open WebUI - https://openwebui.com: While primarily designed for Open WebUI, it hosts a range of models
#    that might also be adaptable for use with Ollama. Ensure compatibility before use

# Number of GPUs to allocate to the Ollama service.
# Specify '1' to use a single GPU, ideal for environments where resources are shared or for less GPU-intensive tasks
# Use 'all' to allocate all available GPUs, which is suitable for high-performance tasks that benefit from parallel computing across multiple GPUs
# Make sure to uncomment and configure the corresponding GPU section in the YAML file for NVIDIA GPU support if you wish to use your GPU for processing
